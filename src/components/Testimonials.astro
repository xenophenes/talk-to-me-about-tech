            <em>Sarah contributed to our Marketing team's strategic and tactical successes. She is a gifted Postgres technologist, thought leader, presenter, and writer. Sarah helped make an essential EDB BigAnimal Postgres-as-a-Service launch the success it had to be, which involved her writing blogs, creating demos, and developing a QuickStart guide - all of which were intrinsic to our release planning. Not every strategist is willing to "roll up the sleeves" in this manner, which made it all the more appreciated by our small Product Marketing team.</em>
